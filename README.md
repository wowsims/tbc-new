# WoW The Burning Crusade Classic Simulator

Welcome to the WoW The Burning Crusade Classic simulator! If you have questions or are thinking about contributing, [join our discord](https://discord.gg/jJMPr9JWwx) to chat!

The primary goal of this project is to provide a framework that makes it easy to build a DPS sim for any class/spec, with a polished UI and accurate results. Each community will have ownership / responsibility over their portion of the sim, to ensure accuracy and that their community is represented. By having all the individual sims on the same engine, we can also have a combined 'raid sim' for testing raid compositions.
